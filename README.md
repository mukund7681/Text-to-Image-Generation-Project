‚úÖ Project Overview:
A complete deep learning pipeline combining NLP and computer vision to generate images from text descriptions using GANs

üß† Key Components:
 Text Tokenization & Encoding using pre-trained models like BERT or GPT.
 Dataset Analysis on public datasets (e.g., COCO, Oxford-102 Flowers), including:
  Number of classes
  Description lengths
  Image resolutions
  Paired image-text visualization
Conditional GAN (CGAN) to generate basic visuals (e.g., "circle", "square") from text labels.
End-to-End Text-to-Image Pipeline integrating text preprocessing, embedding, and GAN-based generation.
Attention Mechanisms (self-attention & cross-attention) added to the GAN for enhanced image quality.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
  Python, PyTorch / TensorFlow
  Hugging Face Transformers
  GAN architectures (DCGAN, CGAN)
  Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, PIL
  
üéØ Goal:
To simulate a real-world text-to-image generation system by combining multiple deep learning concepts and improving generation quality through attention.
üìÇ Project Use Cases:
Educational demonstration of GANs with conditional inputs
Prototyping AI art or caption-to-image systems
Research on attention-based generative models
